# mini-shop

**Data management:** I implement data management (creation, modification and removal of data) in the mysql format. The data management is a key element to the design of site.

**User management:** You able to create and delete your account. You can put all of the items what do you want into basket, but to buy it you must get authorization on site.

**Basket:** It contain the list of products that you wants to buy, the price and the quantity of each article, as well as the total cost.

**Admin:** Admin able to add, delete or modify products on site, also admin get all information about orders.

To run this project you need to have some local server. On Mac I use ```MAMP``` and on Windows ```XAMPP``` with port: ***8080***
